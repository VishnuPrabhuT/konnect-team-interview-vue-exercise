# Remarks


-> Used Vue 2 as I tried migrating the sample app to Vue 3 but it proved to be really time consuming.
-> Implemented search & pagination with vuex and by reusing soe of the kongponents and making custom components where necessary to save time.
-> If I could spend more time I would focus on writing unit & e2e tests.



# Welcome
Goal: make this vue app as close to this mock https://www.figma.com/file/zeaWiePnc3OCe34I4oZbzN/Service-Card-List?node-id=0%3A1 as possible

The styling should be responsive and look good different browser window sizes.
You may use the component doc to help style your components: https://kongponents.netlify.app/components/card.html
